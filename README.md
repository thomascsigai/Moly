# Overview

The MOLY Engine is a 3D game engine designed with a primary focus on creating high-quality rendering capabilities. Currently, it's in a phase of development that concentrate exclusively on building a robust and feature-rich renderer. This renderer will serve as the foundation for future expansions and functionalities of the engine.

# Features to be implemented

  - **Advanced Lighting Models**: Including Phong Lighting and Physically Based Rendering (PBR).
  - **Model Loading and Management**: Support for loading and managing complex 3D models.
  - **Normal and Shadow Mapping**: Techniques for realistic surface detail and dynamic shadows.
  - **Post-processing Effects**: Bloom, Depth of Field, Motion Blur, HDR, and Tone Mapping.
  - **Performance Optimizations**: Frustum Culling, VBOs, VAOs, and Level of Detail (LOD) for efficient rendering.
